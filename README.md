  <h1>About Sauhard Khanal</h1>

  <p>I am being brutally honest.</p>
  <p>
    I am Sauhard Khanal, a simple human being who likes to watch Formula 1 and overthink a little bit.
    I am making this web page because I want to study Computer Science. In my opinion, Aerospace Engineering sounds like too much work.
    I was born on July 11, 2011. I am 5'8.5" tall. I recently went on a trip to the USA, missing a month of school.
    I am a freshman, studying in Sanskriti International School, which takes about NRP 15,000 more than it should every month.
    If you're reading this, then never enroll in Sanskriti, unless you have too much money.
    I am on a goal to save NRP 54,000 before my senior year and double that (NRP 108,000) before I go to college.
    I want to migrate out of Nepal and live somewhere in New York one day.
    The migration process will take place 4 years from June 19th 2025.
